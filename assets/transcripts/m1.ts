In a two-digit number, the rightmost digit is called the ones place. It tells us how many ones we have. For example, in the number 47, the 7 is in the ones place, so we have 7 ones.

The digit on the left is called the tens place. It tells us how many groups of ten we have. In 47, the 4 is in the tens place, so we have 4 groups of ten, which equals 40.

So 47 means 4 tens and 7 ones, or 40 + 7 = 47.

Let's try another example: 32. The 3 is in the tens place (3 tens = 30) and the 2 is in the ones place (2 ones = 2). So 32 = 30 + 2.

Remember: Tens digit shows groups of ten, ones digit shows single units.`;
